package web

// This file was previously used for responsive template testing,
// but those tests were brittle - they checked for specific CSS classes
// rather than actual functionality.
//
// Template functionality is already covered by:
// - embed_test.go: Tests template parsing and embedding
// - Integration tests in internal/server: Test actual HTTP responses
//
// For visual testing, manual browser testing is more appropriate
// than checking for specific CSS class names.
